    ["image" => "fake_money.webp", "title" => "5 ways to detect fake naira note", "body" => "It is possible to tell if someone has given you counterfeit naira notes by looking at the physical characteristics of the bill , such as ink, colors, and text.

    An estimated N100 million worth of counterfeit money is currently circulating in Nigeria . In this guide, we’ll help small business owners equip themselves with the knowledge necessary to detect these fake naira notes.
    
    Counterfeit cash is much less of an issue for businesses that receive most of their revenue through credit card sales. However, if you business receive most of its revenue through physical cash here are 5 ways to know if a naira note is fake.
    
    1. Use mercury bulbs
    Some features of the naira notes cannot be seen with naked eyes.  These features are only in genuine naira notes and one cannot see them except with the help of mercury bulbs.
    
    If a authentic N1000 note is placed under the rays from a mercury bulb, it’ll show a glowing 1,000 in numbers written across the note. But when you place the fake note everything about it will be upside down.
    
    2. Make use of water or liquid
    Make use of water or liquid like petrol Since a fake note is a decorated currency, when you immerse it in liquid and wash it gently against your palm, the colours and watermark will wash off. 
    3. Through the ribbons
    On every paper money on the Naira is a thin silvery ribbon running from the top to the bottom of the note; it’s trashy on old notes.
    
    In real note, you can feel and even pull-out this ribbon on some old notes. However, in counterfeits, there’s something that looks like a ribbon but it’s not—just paint. Try scratching that ribbon, it come off like the silver panel on a recharge card.
    
    4. Paper and colour quality
    
    While counterfeits are made of ordinary papers, real money is made of a special kind of paper. Feeling the paper-quality of counterfeits, you’ll find out that it’s just like that of paper found on the streets. The colours of counterfeits also betray it. The drawings on counterfeits are more blurry, blotchy and sometimes darker than real paper money.
    
    5. Check the gold foil
    The N1000 note comes with a gold foil on the right side beside the CBN governor's signature. You should have it in mind that if you peel the foil of a fake note it will fall off. If the foil fall off that means it is fake.
    
    Of the five methods listed above, the first, second and third are more reliable."],

    ["image" => "traditional.webp", "title" => "WHAT IS POS AND POS BUSINESS", "body" => "Firstly, POS means Point Of Sales payment.  That is, it is a device used for making payment at the point of sell of a product or service.  Base on the unavailability of banking services, the device is used to render banking services to customers and at a commission.  That is, the customer who wants to get N10,000.00 cash, makes payment of N10,200.00 with his/her ATM card and you the agent pays him/her N10,000.00 only, making N200.00 profit.  From the N200.00, the POS company takes about 0.6%, which is N60.00 and leaves you with N140.00.  

    If you are able to do 100 transactions in a day, you will have N140.00 x 100 = N14,000.00
    
    You need an outlet like shop or small place with Umbrella, small table, chair, book and pen for the recording of all the transactions done with date for reference purposes.
    
    Remember, the people selling recharge card sell with N2.00 and a roll of N1,000.00 recharge card, gives the seller N20.00.
    
    So, if you are very careful and limit your transactions with small amount of 2k, 3k and 5k, the N20,000.00 will be giving you an average of N300.00 a day.  If you now have someone very close to you that you can transfer the 20k and get another cash of 20k, you can still finish it and get another N300.00.  This is, if it is for only withdrawals.  Now, if you get some deposits, you will still get commission from the deposit.
    
    With as little as N20,000.00 you can start.  If you charge the customer N400.00 for N20,000.00 and another customer comes with N20,000.00 cash to be transferred into his/her account or to another account, you still charge N300.00 or more, depending on your location.  This N20,000.00 can be giving you average of N500.00 daily after POS company commission.  The more money you have, the more commission you make.  
    
    Another way to build up the business is by having good business relationship with your neighbours who are into building materials, provision shops and cement sales.  Make friends with them and give them free transfer and use the cash to run your POS and cover the charges from the commission from the cash.  That is OPM (Other People's Money) strategy.
    
    Note:. When you don't have much cash, use the strategy called * Little Amount Pay Out*  until someone bring in cash for you to transfer (Deposit).
    
    However, it is better to start small and grow big.  If you have relatives that do business and always transfer the money into their account, you can agree with them to deposit the money with you, you use the money for POS and then move it into their account.
    
    As a beginner, go for POS machine that does not have daily, weekly or monthly target, so that you will have Rest Of Mind (ROM) because you will not be under any pressure to meet up with your target.
    
    If you are interested but don't have the money to start, I will give you secured links for online loan.  After getting your POS machine, with as little as 30k, you can start your POS business and concentrate on only on withdrawal of little amount until you start to get customers.
    
    As a Aggregator, I don't just give you POS machine but guide you in the business.   Pay On Delivery available on Terms and Conditions."],
